# Install

```sh
npm i carbon-icons -S
```

#### Install legacy versions

We no longer publish to ops-console npm registries. We will publish older versions of bluemix-icons to public npm on a per-request basis. All of our existing versions of bluemix-icons is still available on ops-console regsitries so you can follow these instructions to install them.

Set up sinopia: This is the internal npm registry for Bluemix. Set up your repo to install icons from this registry to use carbon-icons.

Create an **.npmrc** file (you can create this in the root of your project folder or on your computer's **~** directory).

```sh
$ touch .npmrc
```

Next, write the following into your **.npmrc** file:

```
//dev-console-npm.stage1.ng.bluemix.net/:_authToken="u6vjQywpRv51/eKBiRcAFA=="
@console:registry=https://dev-console-npm.stage1.ng.bluemix.net/
```

If you haven't done so already, create a **package.json** for your project:

```sh
$ npm init
```

Finally, install carbon-icons with `npm`.


```sh
npm install --save @console/bluemix-icons
```

#### Bower

We don't support Bower anymore, please use npm instead.

#### Download 
You can also **download** a `.zip` or `.tar.gz` file from the [latest releases here.](https://github.ibm.com/Bluemix/bluemix-icons/releases)

# Polyfill

Using `carbon-icons` or previous versions of `bluemix-icons` relies on the use of [external svg content](https://css-tricks.com/svg-sprites-use-better-icon-fonts/##Browser+Support) via `<use>` and `xlink:href`.
For browser-compatibility, we require the use of the [svgxuse](https://github.com/Keyamoon/svgxuse) polyfill.

Install `svgxuse` and include it in your HTML.

```sh
npm install --save svgxuse
```

```html
<!--index.html-->
<body>
  ...
  <script src="svgxuse.js" defer></script>
</body>
```

You can also `import` or `require` it into your main JavaScript file and bundle it with `Webpack`:

```js
// bundle.js
const svgxuse = require('svgxuse');
```

```html
<!--index.html-->
<body>
  ...
  <script src="path_to_bundle.js"></script>
</body>
```

## Inline SVG

If you opt to inline SVG, be aware of the drawbacks:

- No caching
- Manual lookup and download of individual SVG icons
- Will fall out of sync with future updates to `bluemix-icons`

If you're using [bluemix-components-react](https://github.ibm.com/Bluemix/bluemix-components-react), SVG icons are inlined by default via `Icon` component and will still stay in-sync with future versions of blueix-icons.
